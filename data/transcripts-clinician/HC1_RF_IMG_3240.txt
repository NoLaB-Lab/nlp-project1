It is eleven twenty-one twenty three and I'm going to have you tell me a little bit about a trip or vacation some time of excursion you had that you enjoyed in the past.
Oh, okay. 
Our last cruise was up to Canada.
And we stopped at Halifax in Nova Scotia and came down to Portland and ate a lot of good lobster and had fun. 
Nice! Did you do excursions off the boat?
Yes.
Yep.
We took, for that one we took a horse drawn carriage through town whose name I can't remember.
And that was pretty cool.
And we went and saw an old village where the people in the village they all dressed up like they would've back when the village was founded.
Yeah.
Saw some pretty, pretty spectacular views in Canada. 
And. 
That sounds good. Ok. 
Yeah.
