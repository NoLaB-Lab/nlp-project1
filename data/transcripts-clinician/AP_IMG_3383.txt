It is twelve six twenty three, and I'm just gonna ask you to tell me a little bit about a trip of some sort that you've taken in the past that was enjoyable.
I went to grand canyon Pennsylvania just like the grand canyon, but it's in a in a smaller scale and it's it's natural made, it wasn't made by man and we didn't go all the way down because I was too scared, we could see it from the top.
And it is called the grand canyon Pennsylvania.
I have never heard of that, I have to look it up, what part is it near?
That I don't remember, but I remember driving to it from Waterloo, New York to the grand canyon Pennsylvania.
Did you stay there for a few days or do some hiking?
Just for hiking yeah.
Nice, how long does it take to hike it?
I didn't as I said, we didn't hike all the way down, but, couple of hours I would say.
Oh that is so neat, did you do that recently or?
No that was many years ago.
Yeah, alright okay.
But it's in my memory, yeah.
