I have just one more thing to ask you about. I'm asking people to tell me about a memory from their past, like a childhood memory or when you are young, that was like a bad memory, hopefully nothing too traumatic but do you have a memory of something that happened?
Yeah, when I was six years old, there was a civil war in the Dominican Republic and I remember walking with my father, and my father was one of the targets they they had selected to eliminate because he was part of the government that overthrew the communist government that was elected and so I remember the bullets flying over our heads.
Oh, my goodness well that's a terrible memory, oh, my goodness, but I know from our history that he lived until well until his nineteens, so you made it, that was scary. 
Did that last for a long time or was it brief?
It was from April to about November because that the American troops inter intervened to get everything in order, until 1966 there was a regular elections.
But yeah, the American presence was visible.
Oh, my goodness what a memory.
