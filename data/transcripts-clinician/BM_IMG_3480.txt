It is twelve nineteen twenty three, and I'm gonna have you first tell me a little bit about a nice trip or vacation or something that you've taken in your past that you've enjoyed.
I don't go on a lot of vacations.
Or even a trip to like Texas like your wife was saying if you visit family.
Yeah, we got, we go to visit our our my wife's sister and her husband, and her family, with lots of with lots of their grandchildren there and it's good for my wife, she, it's good for her to get back home two thousand miles away from where we are now.
And it's good, good to be in touch with, with their family and get to do things and to hear their accents and to eat lots of food and just have a good time.
Nice, what part of Texas is it?
West Texas. Yeah it hardly rains.
One of the thing about that place you know, when I take a walk, I don't hardly sweat, and that's, that's unusual for me, cause it's just so dry, so dry. You listen to the news and humidity today twenty percent you know or something like that. And so, it's a real dry place and and they they grow they grow, they, my wife, my wife's father head, their land had oil on it and also they had they had beef, but it was cattle beef cattle, it wasn't, it wasn't milk cattle you know because because not enough water. 
So, you go to the store, and when you want to buy milk it's a lot of money it's a lot of money cause they have to ship it in but the beef it's a lot cheaper than around here.
Ok.
