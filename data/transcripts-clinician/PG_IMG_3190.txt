I'm going to ask you to tell me a little but about a childhood memory that wasn't great hopefully not too traumatic, but we all kind of remember something from childhood. I feel like a lot of us do that was.
I think one memory that I can tell you about is that I was in the garage and I was doing something that my father whatever and the bench fell on my leg over on my leg and broke my leg. 
Oh no.
Had to go to the hospital and get set stuff like that.
That was a long time ago.
I don't even I can't tell you the year but thats one of things I do remember the most.
Oh poor kid, how old were you, do you know? 
I want to say fourteen-ish, fourteen, fifteen.
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, that age.
Poor guy. 
But okay it hasn't bothered me all my life.
Yeah, I really haven't had an issue.
Good okay.
