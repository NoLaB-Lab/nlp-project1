Well, we went to Italy. I enjoyed Italy, enjoyed the food. I enjoyed the wine and the women are fantastic. It's not the safest place in the world but you kind of live with, you kind you live with it.
You know you're supposed to lock your house and close your windows and all that staff. Okay. And but everything was fine I mean.
Did you live there or vacation? 
No, I lived there.
Stayed there for about three years.
What part?

But like I said it's not, it's not the safest place to live but.
Did you speak Italian? 
I spoke a little bit, yeah, a little bit.
Did you work there or no? 
Yes I did. I worked at the gym.
Cool. And what's your wife do? Because you mentioned it was her job.
