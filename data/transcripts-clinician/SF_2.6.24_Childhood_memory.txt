We have one more thing and tell me a little bit about a childhood memory that wasn’t good, hopefully nothing too scary but something you remember from your youth that was a bad memory. When I was around eight or nine years old I had problems with a kidney that I don’t remember too too good but all I remember is I was in the hospital when I was around nine years old and I was away from home for over a week which was upsetting. And I remember the good part of that was my aunts and uncle came to visit me in the hospital but I missed my brothers quite a bit and my parents and hospitals were a lot of different back then, it was sort of colder feeling. And I was left there alone over night in the child’s floor and the the only thing I remember is I talked to my brothers quite a few times during the week that I was there and and and seem so distant even though they were only a few blocks away really. I was at it was called XX hospital we lived in east Utica and my parents my dad worked so he only come see me in night and my mom take care of my brothers so she would come see me when she can but I was alone in the hospital at young age so it was it was not a memory that I am fond of but I do remember. So things are different today. You can do things differently with the kid in the hospital somehow make it work little easier but back then it was hard juggling with work in and another children so I was alone feeling being there that long. But that’s one memory I have in my childhood.All right.
