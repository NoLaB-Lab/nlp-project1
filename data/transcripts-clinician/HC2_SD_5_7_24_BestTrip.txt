The date is May first, twenty twenty four. And I am just ganna ask you to tell me a little bit about a trip that you’ve taken in the past.  Oh, I just went to Merlo beach Polihrono down there. We went down to, had some problems with it so went to observe it and see how the work was coming in it. We had a little free time away from all the people at home. It was cold. Was like two good days.It was a nice trip. My husband’s sister, her husband was there. So, we had a nice time. Anything else, you tell me a little more.   Visiting, visiting our nephews, lives down there. That’s about it. Went out to eat. Didn’t get to the beach because it was cold.That’s about all we did.
