I'm also ask, going to ask you to tell me a story about a bad, hopefully not too traumatic, but like a bad childhood memory if you have any or adolescent something that happened that wasn't, wasn't great.
I remember when I was very young.
Well not very, maybe about ten years old my father worked in a summer camp and a few of us kids were horsing around and we were climbing out of a window and I sort of fell and hit my wrist and broke my wrist which made my the rest of the summer, this was in the beginning of the summer, not too much fun cause I had a cast on my wrist for like three-quarters of the summer. 
Oh, my goodness did your dad, did you get in trouble for it or ?
Yeah, minor, minor trouble.
Yeah, letâ€™s see.
That's okay, that's fine.
