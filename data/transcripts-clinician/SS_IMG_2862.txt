I'm going to have you to tell me a little bit about a trip that you've taken that you enjoyed.
Six years ago we went to Disney World. It was my forth time being here. 
And went with my daughter and her husband, and my grandson Nicholas. 
And it was wonderful. We were there for a week, whole week. It it was just wonderful. I mean things from Disney that I remember from years ago, new things, it was, it was, it was great. Got a lot of pictures and videos. 
What do you think the highlight was? What was your favorite experience? 
The Hollywood Tower of Terror I think they call it where have you have you been
The Hollywood Tower of Terror.
They put on a ride and you go and you are like in this big quany mention. 
And you you can't see a thing really until you know what is coming up because you can see this this tower, this elevator tower open, really high, and then you hear people screaming. Because then it drops you to the bottom.
That sounds terrible. 
No, it was wonderful, it was wonderful, it really was, it is very good experience. 
Oo, thank you.
