I'm going to have you told me about a nice vacation or a fun vacation you took at some time. It can be any time in your life. A trip. 
One of our favorite things to do is go to Myrtle Beach.
In April, April, May, every year and we visit friends and that sort of thing.
They come down with us sometimes.
I brought my kids down there, two family, whole family down there. 
Do you stay on the water? 
Yeah.
We have a timeshare.
Okay so we use the timeshare.
We stay on the beach most of the time, travel around and eat.
And the place has places where you can have bbq grill and stuff like that.
They have it out there either propane or charcoal.
Do pools and hot tubs everything like that. 
I don’t do that I don't like that stuff.
I mean I'll do the pool and the ocean is kind of cool.
Other than that the kids have a ball.
They do the sandy beach and stuff like that.
That's a good time.
Yeah it's fun.
We usually stay the week. 
Do you get golfing?
Not usually.
Not if the kids come because we have one vehicle.
Oh I see.
I've been using the cooking man that my car while I'm working.
When I'm done at the end of the year I really don't know yet.
It seems alright to say it if you still want to come around or not cause he's paying me something obviously but I’m still a director.
Right.
That's why giving an attitude me just like my car or my home in Massachusetts.
I see okay. 
We get together and we actually.
