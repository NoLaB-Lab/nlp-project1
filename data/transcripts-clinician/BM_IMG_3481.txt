Story about something.
I know, yes, one more story. This one can be really interesting. I want you to tell me about a childhood or adolescent memory that wasn't, hopefully not too traumatic, but something that was a bad childhood memory.
Yeah, next door was this big tree. 
And, we kids thought it would be cool to climb up in the tree.
And, and we had a board. 
And I don't know if we made like a little sign on it or not.
But we climbed skimmed up the tree and pounded that board into, into that tree.
And so around the corner was a funeral home and the man, the director of the home was called Van Dusen, Mr. Van Deusen.
And so all us kids were were we had those, we had those this this board in the tree.
And and and so so somebody said Van Deusen to get that board out of that tree.
So I climbed up, yanked the thing down, threw, threw it down, and I jumped out of the thing and right on the board with the nails up.
And I'm walking around screaming, and, and, and I'm walking with the board in my walking, stocked in my my sneaker you know, blood all over the place.
And I'm screaming bloody bloody murder my mom comes running out and stuff like that
And I'm yelling I hate you Van Deusen.
And I'm so
Obviously, we went to the doctor and it was for like months and it was hard to even walk.
Just trying to recuperate from it.
Poor guy.
