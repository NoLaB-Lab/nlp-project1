Ok this is SF. Date is two six twenty-four. I just like you to tell me about vacation or trip you’ve taken in life time. It can be any trip when you were younger or whatever. My most recent trip I went to South Carolina to visit my brother who resides there part time and I went down there with my daughter, son in law, and the some other family members.And it was enjoyable because it was a first time I ever been to the beach, real beach, and so so fun time and I don’t leave New York State that often so and and it was a condo, made a pool there, and the water is good for me. I have artificial need.So, I got to spend time in an ocean and also the pool that they had, a heated pool.So for the week that I was there, I was very enjoyable spend time with family and also to rehab my knee quite often the time I was there. So there was my most recent trip and it was enjoyable for two reasons.Good, ok. Thank you.
