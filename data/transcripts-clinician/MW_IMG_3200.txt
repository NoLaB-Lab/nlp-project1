Alright.
How's it going today?
It's November fifteen and I'm going to have you tell me about a trip that you have taken. It can be any time actually maybe just the trip that you just took in a little bit tell me about it.
Well I got on the plane in Syracuse. 
I went to Baltimore airport and then we went to Albuquerque where I got off the plane and Gale Darby, my RN picked me up and we went to her son's place.
And that's where I stayed. 
And Friday we sat, Friday we did a few things. 
And then Saturday we went to the Bloom Festival and on a bus trip which was the easiest and cheapest way of getting here because for twenty five dollars we took the bus from the shopping mall and the price of getting in in the bus ride was twenty five dollars. 
Oh nice. 
So it was really reasonable and the bus dropped us right off the place we entered the Bloom Festival which was better than walking a half mile from the parking lot.
Oh yeah forget that.
It also including the handicap which was a half mile lane too but we did that for several hours, 
came back and rested. We went up to Santa Fe. 
It was a Mon, Monday yeah Monday. 
We went up to Santa Fe.
We went to checked out the oldest house in the United States and the oldest church in the United States.
Oh my goodness.
We were going to eat out there but they also were having a festival at that day which the center where we wanted to eat was all filled out and there was no place to park. 
Okay alright.
