One more story I'll ask you to tell me is.
I'm asking people to tell me about something, a bad memory from your youth. Like when you were younger. Hopefully, nothing too traumatic but just something when you were a little or a teenager.
I don't really remember.
There was a I was climbing up a tree in a neighbor's yard and she caught me. 
And not only did she chew me out but she hit me several times.
Oh no.
And I went home and talked to my father about it and he says well you shouldn't have been up in the tree.
And that's about all I can remember about it.
Ok that's fair.
