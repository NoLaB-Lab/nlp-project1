Now, one more thing I'll ask you to tell me about a childhood memory that wasn't good, like a sad, hopefully not too dramatic.
Yeah. A bad memory from childhood. 
I have fairly good, you know, no issues that I can really remember but I do remember falling out of a tree. Thank God it wasn't too high.
Reaching for the next one and the next one and all of a sudden you are reaching it and you don't get it and "pew bam" 
It wasn't horrible but it hurt. It hurt, yeah.
Did you break anything?
No, I never had a broken bone.
Good.
Thank God.
Ok.
